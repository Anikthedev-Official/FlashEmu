# ⚡ FlashEmu Pro

**The ultimate, high-performance Flash emulator for Android.** 

FlashEmu Pro isn't just a player—it's a complete input environment. It is designed to make complex Flash games (like *Stick War*) fully playable on mobile devices by bridging the gap between touchscreens and keyboard/mouse controls.

## 🌟 Pro Features

### 🕹️ Advanced Hybrid Input System
Stop fighting with basic touch controls. FlashEmu Pro offers three distinct interaction modes:
*   **Joystick Mode:** Classical virtual stick for movement and cursor control.
*   **Direct Touch:** The screen becomes your trackpad. Tap and slide to move the cursor instantly.
*   **Super Mode (Hybrid):** The power-user setup. The **Joystick** sends Keyboard events (WASD/Arrows) while the **Touch Screen** controls the mouse. Perfect for strategy and action games.

### 🛠️ Custom Layout Engine (Visual Editor)
Don't settle for a fixed UI. Create your own controller:
*   **Visual Editor:** A dedicated layout page to drag and drop buttons and joysticks.
*   **Precision Mapping:** Set exact X/Y percentages for every control.
*   **Universal Actions:** Map any button to a Mouse Click (L/M/R), any Keyboard key (A-Z, 0-9), or complex combos.
*   **JSON Ecosystem:** Export your custom layouts to JSON files to share your "pro setups" with other players. (will soon be added)

### 🚀 Performance & Optimization
**NOT** Built specifically to run on low-end hardware (tested on 3GB RAM / Android 8.1):
*   **Dual-Engine Architecture:** Switch between **Legacy (v2021)** for old-school compatibility and **Modern (v2026)** for the latest Ruffle features.
*   **Turbo Mode (Potato Mode):** A one-tap boost that tries disables heavy realism effects to multiply your FPS on weak GPUs.
*   **Realism Mode:** High-fidelity real-time mouse tracking for games that require precise "hover" events.
*    **WARNING:** PLEASE DONT TRY ON LOWEND DEVICES (FOR RESOURCE EXPENSIVE GAMES) IT CONVERENTS FLASH TO SOME RUFFLE THING TO WASM OR SOEETIHNG IDK AND YOU HAVE YOUR TIHNG LOW END DEVICES DONT HANDLE THAT VERY WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



### 📚 Game Library & Management
*   **JSON Database:** Organize your games by category (Strategy, Action, etc.).
*   **Multi-Source Loading:** Load `.swf` files from your phone's internal storage or directly via Web URLs.
*   **Smart Boot:** A custom boot-loader with a progress bar ensures the engine is fully initialized before the game starts.
