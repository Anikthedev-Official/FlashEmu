Since your project has become a full-blown, professional-grade emulator, your
README should reflect that. It needs to look great on GitHub to show off all the
hard work you put into the hybrid controls and engine switching.

Here is a complete, high-quality README.md.

To use this:

1.  Open your README.md file.
2.  Delete everything inside it.
3.  Paste the code below.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🕹️ Hybrid Input System
*   **Joystick Mode:** Classic virtual stick for movement and cursor control.
*   **Direct Touch:** Tap anywhere on the screen to move the cursor instantly.
*   **Super Mode (Hybrid):** The ultimate setup. Use the joystick to send keyboard inputs (WASD/Arrows) to the game while using the touch screen to aim the mouse.

### ⚙️ Pro-Level Customization
*   **Custom Layout Editor:** A full visual editor to place buttons and joysticks anywhere on the screen.
*   **Action Mapping:** Map any button to a Mouse Click (L/M/R) or any Keyboard key (A-Z, 0-9, Space, Enter, etc.).
*   **Export/Import:** Save your custom layouts to JSON and share them with other players.
*   **Dynamic Sizing:** Real-time slider to adjust the size of your controls to fit your fingers.

### 🛠️ Engine & Performance
*   **Dual-Engine Support:** Switch between **Legacy (v2021)** for older games (like Stick War) and **Modern (v2026)** for newer Flash content.
*   **Turbo Mode (Potato Mode):** Optimized for low-end devices (3GB RAM). It uses resolution scaling and `pixelated` rendering to boost FPS on old hardware.
*   **Realism Mode:** Real-time mouse tracking that sends continuous events to the game for smooth hover effects.

### 📚 Game Management
*   **JSON Game Library:** A built-in database to organize and launch your favorite SWF files.
*   **Local & Web Loading:** Load games directly from your phone's storage or via a web URL.
*   **Virtual Keyboard:** A full slide-up keyboard for games that require typing.
